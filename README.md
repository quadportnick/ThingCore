# ThingCore
This is my common library for "things" around the house. It's currently based around the ESP8266 chip with Arduino programming. It provides base WiFi (captive portal config), HTTP (status, config, update), PubSub (MQTT), and WebSockets code to my other personal projects. Maybe this will be of some use to others to look at as I learn and improve it.

## Referenced Libraries
I'm taking advantage of these projects:
* ArduinoJson
* ESP8266HTTPUpdateServer
* PubSubClient
* WebSocketsServer
* WiFiManager
